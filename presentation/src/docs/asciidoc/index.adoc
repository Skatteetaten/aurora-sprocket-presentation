== Intro
* Kristoffer Moberg Christensen, Trainee in the Norwegian Tax Administration(NTA)
* Bjarte Stien Karlsen, Architect & Developer in NTA

== Demo1
 * Show simple asciicinema demo

== Agenda
* *Background*
* Sprocket
* Use cases
* Future plans

== Background
 * Running OpenShift since 2015
 * Semantic Version based version strategy
 * BuildConfig, CustomBuilder and triggers for building
 * Scheduled ImageStreams for rolling out new version

== Skatteetaten og Kubernetes
* 6 clusters
* 120 nodes
* 5500 pods
* on-prem OpenShift 3.11

 * alpine classifier

== What is missing?
 * what is the base image when no classifier
 * what version of the base image is used
 * what if the build logic changes

== Aurora Version
plantuml::versionStrategy.puml["versionStrategy", png]

== Build
plantuml::buildConfig.puml["buildConfig1", png]

== BaseImage Change
plantuml::buildConfig2.puml["buildConfig2", png]

== Code change
plantuml::buildConfig3.puml["buildConfig3", png]

== Updating what is running
 * Scheduled ImageStreams Controller
 * And DeploymentConfig Controller
 * Both build into OpenShift

== Features and bugfixes
plantuml::imageStream.puml["imageStream1", png]

== Problem #1: Performance
Polling for new changes to lots of images all the time does not scale

== Problem #2: Race condition on multiple triggers
If a Pod has two containers and both have new versions who triggers first?

== Problem #3: No flow control
Updating the base image/builder will fire every single build at the same time

== Needs
 * push based, reacting to events/webhooks
 * support Nexus (hosted/grouped repos)
 * support OpenShift resources
 * enable flow control
 * rate limiting

== Can OpenSource help?
 * looked at a lot of alternatives
 * most are based on polling
 * most promising is https://keel.sh/docs/#introduction[keel]
 ** supports WebHook/push based
 ** does not support OpenShift resources
 ** does not support Nexus Container Registry
 ** no flow control

== What primitives can help us here?
 * notifications from DockerRegistries
 * notifications from build pipelines
 * labels on resources enable efficient queries
 * label values have limitations, so sha1 the content.
 * CRD are possible to complex workflow/configuration

== Build our own
 * No OpenSource solution so we decided to build our own based on notifications from Nexus Container Registry notifications
 * Current solution ties us to OpenShift

== Agenda
* Background
* *Sprocket*
* Use cases
* Future plans

== Sprocket

[state=red-font]
== Sprocket MVP
plantuml::sprocket.puml["sprocket", png]

== Sequence
* listen to globalEventHook
* filter out garbage events
* parse event into a ImageChangeEvent(s)
** one hosted registry can have several groups so it can fire multiple events
* find related kubernetes resources
* perform builds/deployments/imports

== Limitations
 * no resilience if event fails
 ** we get an alert from Nexus but nothing automatic
 * only support a single cluster
 * no flow control
 * only support deploy on OpenShift via ImageStream

== Permissions
 - needs propper RBAC permissions
 -- list ImageStream, create ImageStreamUpdate

== Agenda
* Background
* Sprocket
* *Use cases*
* Future plans


== Use cases
 * Can you just start to use it?
 * It depends on how you build and version images
 * MVP support Nexus Container Registry and ImageStreams

== Version Strategy
plantuml::versionStrategy.puml["versionStrategy", png]

== Use Sprocket for rolling out "patches"
 * you rebuild an existing tag when there is a "bug"
 * usage pattern:
 ** install sprocket in your cluster
 ** configure Nexus Docker Registry global event hook
 ** label you resources

== Agenda
* Background
* Sprocket
* Use cases
* *Future plans*

== Plan: Expand resources
- DeploymentConfig
- Deployment/StatefulSet/DaemonSet
- BuildConfig
- Sprocket CRD for 1-to-many semantics
-- utdype alle disse

== Plan: Audit log
 - Make an audit log of ImageChangeEvents for observability

== Plan: Cache Manifest
 * on an ImageChangeEvent cache part of the Manifest for internal use in developer tools

== Plan: Fallback loop
 * Sometimes events will fail
 * Create a fallback loop that will periodically check if everything is up to date
 ** fire a ImageChangeEvent if not up to date

== Plan: Rate limit and flow control
 - Enable configuration of rate limit in sprocket
 - All changes from a single ImageChangeEvent will be flow controlled
 - Ensure that a single ImageChangeEvent does not fire multiple rollouts of the same resource

== Plan: Support multiple clusters
 - distribute the ImageChangeEvent to multiple clusters
 - option: write to multiple master apis?
 - option: kafka?

== Plan: Tekton
 - Can tekton be used to enable complex workflows?
 - Make a ImageChangeEvent something that fires a tekton pipeline
